Openlibm is an effort to have a high quality independent 
libm library. It is meant to be used standalone in applications and
programming language implementations, and perhaps even as a reference
for libm implementations in OSes.

The Openlibm code derives from the FreeBSD 8.2 msun implementation,
which in turn derives from FDLIBM 5.3.
