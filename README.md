OpenLIBM is an effort to have a high quality independent LIBM
library. It is meant to be used standalone in applications and
programming language implementations, and perhaps even as a reference
for LIBM implementations in OSes.

The OpenLIBM code derives from the FreeBSD msun implementation, which
in turn derives from FDLIBM 5.3.
